For a while now in personal projects i’ve been using the [Less][1] CSS pre-processor for my stylesheets. I absolutely love it, and i’ve now begun moving into using it with some Hydrant projects too, and using it with [Drupal][2], and i have to say - i love it even more now.

## Compiling LESS Files.

LESS files have the extension `.less` and need to compiled into .css files to be used in a normal browser. However, you can include the `less.js` script into your webpage, and it will do the compilation for you, in real time, when you view the page. I don’t think i know many people who use this in production websites, but it’s certainly great for quick development.

When it comes to compiling for production usage, you’ve got a few options:

### Using drupal? There’s a module for that.

The [LESS][3] module takes the .less files declared in your theme’s .info file and processes them using the LESSPHP compiler.

### Using node.js?

Lucky you! LESS was written using node.js and there’s a node compiler available via npm (the node package manager).

### Using Mac?

Either [CodeKit][4] or [Less.app][5] will do you, they’re both fantastic applications and Less.app is free, too!

### Using windows?

[WinLess][6] is the one for you!

### Using anything linux or anything else?

Then you’ll probably have to install the `lessc` command line tool and node.js manually. It’s a bit of a pain but it’s worth it. Instructions are on the [official site][1].

## Why LESS is different

LESS is kinda like CSS for developers, it drops in things like *Variables*, *Mixins* (think functions), *Nesting*, *Namespacing* and a few other niceties that just take out some of the pains that come with writing stylesheets while building on all the things you love about them. I’m of course not going to go over everything you can do with LESS, but i’ll touch on a few of the things that i use the most.

### Variables

You can declare variables to use as values in your stylesheet, meaning that you could declare something like a brand colour, or your entire color scheme, as variables, and when a rebrand comes along, you could just alter them instead of finding and replacing all those references to `#bada55` in your stylesheet.

Example:

{% highlight css %}
@brandColor:#bada55; /* Declare your brand colour */
{% endhighlight %}

Then later on in your stylesheet:

{% highlight css %}
background-color:@brandColor;
{% endhighlight %}

As simple as that!

### Mixins

Mixins are like functions, they contain styles that can be re-used as groups later on in your stylesheet, and they can even accept parameters, changing the values on a per-usage basis.

The best example of this is probably something like a `border-radius` mixin, so that it sets up all the neccessary browser-specific prefixes for you.

In your .less file, you would write:

{% highlight css %}
.border-radius-all(@radiusSize) {
    -webkit-border-radius:@radiusSize;
    -moz-border-radius:@radiusSize;
    border-radius:@radiusSize;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then after that’s been declared, you could use it in a rule like so:
{% highlight css %}
#container {
    padding: 20px;
    border:1px solid black;
    .border-radius-all(4px);
}
{% endhighlight %}

This would then compile to:

{% highlight css %}
#container {
    padding: 20px;
    border:1px solid black;
    -webkit-border-radius:4px;
    -moz-border-radius:4px;
    border-radius:4px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

And you can re-use this everywhere! Awesome, no?

### Inheritance

So in a normal cascading stylesheet, in order to constrain a class within the context of another div, you’d write it like this:

{% highlight css %}
#somediv { width:400px; }
#somediv .inner { width:380px;border:1px solid black; }
{% endhighlight %}

But in LESS, you can write it more naturally, almost emulating the structure of the HTML in your styles:

{% highlight css %}
#somediv {
    width:400px;
    .inner {
        width:380px;
        border:1px solid black;
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Nice, no? It might seem like a silly little difference, but take it from me, when you’re writing huge stylesheets with lots of sub-elements, this becomes an elegant (and very natural) way to write declarations.

### Finally - inline functions.

Because LESS is based on Javascript, you can do some neat little things that help mathematically and design challenged individuals like myself perform quick, computed actions on things like hex colors and sizes.

You can do mathematical things like:

{% highlight css %}
@basePadding: 10px;
@doublePadding: @basePadding * 2;
{% endhighlight %}

And yes, it will take care of the ‘px’ for you.

And you can also mutate and alter colors like this:

{% highlight css %}
@baseColor: #bada55;
@hoverColor: lighten(@baseColor, 20%);
@darkerColor: darken(@baseColor, 30%);
{% endhighlight %}

Things like this make such a difference for things like quick HTML prototypes or desigining in the browser.

## Preboot - making LESS work for you.

[Preboot.less][7] by Mark Otto - a twitter employee, is a **MUST HAVE** for anyone using LESS. It provides a basic set of mixins and variables that can kickstart front end development and means less work for you in the long run.

## What LESS kinda sucks at.

I’m a fair man and no technology is perfect, so i want to be clear about what it isn’t very good for:

### Debugging someone else’s LESS is a pain sometimes.

If you work at an agency and have to maintain or fix a bug with someone else’s CSS, and discover they’ve used LESS and the ‘minify’ option when it’s compiled, you can end up gnawing at your own arm while staring at the web inspector. As a rule, i turn off minify for the sanity of myself and others.

### Having two files is obviously bigger than one

Although unless you’re dealing with million line CSS files this really isn’t a big deal…

### <s>The PHP Compiler is a bit buggy.</s>

<s>I’ve been watching the development of the PHP compiler on [Github][8] since the early days, and it’s gotten so much better, but there are still kinks to be worked out.</s>

### Er, that’s about it…from my point of view, anyway.

I can’t say much in the way of bad things about LESS, but it’s still not for everyone. Give it a go, and see what you think.
