The past four or five years have been very mixed for me, but there have definitely been a lot more downs than ups, it's all felt like a very, very slow and painful uphill struggle.

I've battled with depression and anxiety for a *long* time now, i started taking medication for it four years ago, but i've been fighting it since i was 15 (and i'm 24 now, 9 years), and unfortunately, i've always felt ashamed that i suffer from it, always, and i'm not sure why - mainly because other people don't, or rather can't, understand what it's like, and therefore you simply come across as lazy, miserable, and freakish. This of course is only my own experience, but i'd bet that others have suffered similar things.

Luckily, in the past two years, things have solidified - getting up in the morning is now a lot easier than it used to be (although it's still hard, i'm still tired all the time, and still can't concentrate fully on anything when it's needed), i work in an office with great people, they're a laugh, they're smart, and they've gotten me out on the bike for the first time in ~8 years.

My friendship group has solidified too, we're all grown up now, we understand how much responsibility some of us hold, and how precious free time is - so we make the most of it. All the terrible, selfish people have fallen by the wayside, and i'm left with a group who i love being with, love talking to and laughing with, and love drinking with.

I'm excelling in my profession too - i feel like nothing is out of my reach now, given the right time allotted to it, 2 years ago i would never have had the confidence to say that.

What follows in this post are some of the things that have held me back in the past few years - experiences and misconceptions that i've came across that have affected me while trying to pick myself up from the mess i was all those years ago.

### Ambition

Someone who i was very close to once told me that "You have no ambition, drive, or determination";

**Bullshit**, utter bullshit, i couldn't believe they had said that, i still can't, i'd always known what i had wanted to do, to build things that help people, the problem was that, at the time, i had no idea how to achieve that, let alone had the confidence to persue it.

That's the problem with all these illnesses (depression, anxiety) - the fear, tiredness and malaise that comes with them tends to put up a front of laziness, nonchalance and sometimes even anger or bitterness, it makes it even harder to seem like a balanced individual when people misinterprate what you're really feeling. You find yourself hypersensitive to comments from others.

Ambition takes time, wanting to move somewhere or get a job somewhere specific is a great 'Goal' to set - it takes no time at all to either achieve or fail at it, but i don't want something like that, i'm playing the long game, i'm in for the long haul.

### Other people's ideas

Leading on from the last paragraph - one problem i've frequently come across in past years is that one person's definition of ambition and progress is never equal to my own - i bump into people from school all the time who are living in London, manchester, newcastle or even abroad, and they say "Where are you now?", and when i say "Carlisle", i get a short but easily discernable look, the "You're STILL in Carlisle?" patronisation look.

So what if i'm still there? I work with the internet, the most omnipresent piece of technology there is, literally. I mark my progress in life on my personal achievements - what i can do with the tools at my disposal, the number of new things i can learn, and applying these things in a professional manner, if you're living in a bedsit in London,

One thing that i've never understood is people's *drive* to move to a place like London. I've been to london - it's nice, it really is, there's lots to do, and being the capital there's obviously more work, more places to stay, more to visit, more to see. 

I get it, i really do, there's more stimulation there, and wanting 'more' out of your life is no bad thing. But places like that are outside my comfort zone - people don't help each other, people don't say hello or good morning to each other like they do up here, i love the lake district, the air, the scenery, the fact that you can walk around a lake on a saturday morning without having to plan a weekend around it and turn it into a trip away, the whole county is on our doorstep, and i really do love that.

If your only excuse to move to somewhere else is (as i've heard many times from people) that there's 'nothing going on up here', then i'm sorry, but i think that you're not looking hard enough, and also **if you need constant stimulation, then it's probably not the surroundings that are boring, it's probably you**. The best people i know spend their downtime learning, reading, playing games, or doing something constructive, not sitting around complaining that they're fed up.

In other words, who gives a fuck where you are? If you genuinely think i'm worth less than someone else because i'm not working in San Francisco, New York, London, or Manchester, then fuck you, you're a complete arsehole, and more importantly, you're wrong.
