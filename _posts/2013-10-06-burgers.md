It's a Sunday, i'm bored, i'm hungry, and i fancy some burgers, but i don't really fancy a take away or frozen ones, so i figured i'd make my own using a pretty simple recipe that i've figured out over the past year or two.

It's all good stuff - beef, onions, cream crackers, a little spice, and some steak seasoning, cheap enough to acquire and re-make, and you should get about 6 burgers from 500g of minced beef.

### Ingredients ###

- **500g** of **lean minced beef**, better stuff is better for burgers, don't skimp if you can help it.
- One **onion**.
- About **6** regular **cream crackers**, just get the cheapest, they're all the same!
- **Salt** & **Pepper**
- **One egg** (optional but recommended)
- **Steak seasoning** (You can pick this up for pretty cheap)
- **Spicy Stuff**. Like your meat spicy? Add something in to add a bit of a kick, like some hot sauce, paprika, or try something daft like it did and added in some hot peri-peri rub (see below)

### Method ###

Finely chop the onions - you can leave them a bit more chunky if you like (i have here), this adds a bit more bite and crunch to the burger.

Blend the cream crackers in a food processor until they're powedered, or just put them in a freezer bag and crush them with a rolling pin, either way works, and after mixing with the meat, it's hard to taste the difference.

Add the meat to a large bowl, seperate as much as possible so that the seasoning will get in all the gaps, sprinkle plenty of steak seasoning, salt & pepper, and your spice mix if you're using it.

Start mashing all the ingredients together, at first it'll just look like a powdery mess thanks to the cream crackers, but eventually they will 'melt' into the meat, and soak up all the flavour. Eventually you should have a nice lump of meat ready to be shaped, here's where you can crack open, whisk, and add the egg if you want.

Adding an egg is supposed to bind the patties together during cooking, while this is true if the mince you're using is quite fatty (the fat melts during cooking and your burger falls apart), leaner mince tends not to need it.

Next thing: roll your meat into a big long 'loaf', or log, and use a sharp knife to take even-thickness slices from it for each patty, this keeps things roughly the same size. Take the extracted slice, roll into a ball, then flatten into patties!

If you've added enough cream cracker and onion, you should get about 6 patties out of it, plus one smaller one (as a cheeky snack):

### Cooking Them ###

There are a few good ways to cook your burgers:

- The original way, that i used, is to fry them in a little oil either in **frying pan or griddle pan**. Just add about a teaspoon of oil, bring to about medium heat, then cook for about 8 minutes on each side, make sure they're cooked before serving by slicing the edge off one of them.
- You can also **Grill** them of course, but you might want to add a little oil over them to keep them moist. Cook them on low-medium to make sure they cook through.
- **Oven bake**. You can oven bake them and they'll come out lovely and moist and tender, but they won't have the crispy 'skin' that pan fried or grilled burgers do, if you want, you can quickly braze them in a pan on high heat before putting them in the oven to get that desired effect on the outside.

Oven baking is also great if you have put larger, chunkier ingredients in your burgers like pickles etc.

### Serve Them! ###

Serve on a bun of your choice with sauce, mayonaisse and/or relish. I usually serve mine with some lettuce, rocket (only a little - the burgers should be peppery enough), and mayo.

Enjoy! And let me know if you've got any awesome variations on these.
