description: A short personal dialogue about how i struggle to adjust to office hours.

I'm positive i'm not the only person in the web & creative industries who suffers from problems sleeping, but it's certainly becoming a recurring problem in my day-to-day working life.

Take right now, awake and writing this at 1.10am on a thursday morning, with work in 8 hours or so. It's not for lack of trying to get to sleep - i've been in bed since 11.15pm, i showered, cooled off, watched the end of a family guy episode then set about trying to sleep.

I read [a great post from Vic Bell today][2] that spoke of the importance of choosing her own working hours, if i'm honest, i'd love this, to be able to pick when i work, sleep when i'm tired, and work when i feel most inspired. Unfortunately, i know what i'm like.

Freelance work is where i alway thought i'd end up when i left university - working under my own steam, choosing my own clients, and ultimately being happier because i'm not forced to work within a rigid set of time frames, the dreaded nine-to-five.

Truthfully? I work best at night, usually around this time, when there's nothing to distract me, i get the most stuff done, at weekends you'll find me working until 3am on my side projects, then sleeping until 1pm the next day, getting up, taking care of things i need to be done while others are awake and the shops are open, then pulling another late one, this pattern accounts for more continuous hours of productivity than i get through the day, and is responsible for the 100+ hours of coding that make up some of my little side projects.

Freelancing probably isn't for me, i love where i work, i love the office banter, my own desk away from home, and the social element that work has become. I'm currently searching for the best of both worlds, along with a way to vary my hours but still make enough money to be comfortable, and get enough sleep to feel refreshed and attentive, and ready to code.

Sitting at a desk to work while exhausted is hard, i know people probably think 'at least you're not out working on a building site' but being essentially motionless while trying to keep your brain fully active while tired is an odd disconnection - hence the unhealthy amounts of caffeine i've been known to consume. I tend to not be able to sleep at night due to anxiety problems and their side effects, meaning that i'm **tired but wired**.

People who suffer from similar problems will know my pain - not being able to sleep for no particular physical reason is incredibly grating, and the knock on effect to your health, happiness, diet, and work is tangible and frustrating, the past couple of days i've felt particularly unsociable and irritated, although interestingly my productivity hasn't suffered that much at work.

To those telling me to suck it up and get on with it: i've been doing that for 8 years since these problems developed, and i've done well for myself, and i'll keep on sucking it up, and getting on with it, and getting shit done, there are plenty of people out there worse off than me, and i realise that.

I realise that these things are nobodies fault but my own, i don't even have a particular solution that would address them, which i guess why this is so frustrating.

So now, it's 1:40am, and i'm about to try and get to sleep again, accompanied by some south park as background noise so i'm not over-thinking everything, and when my alarm goes off at 7am, we'll see what tomorrow brings.
