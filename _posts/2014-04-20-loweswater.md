I love mountain biking.

I'm terrible at it, but that doesn't mean i can't get out there and do it. Recently i'd been getting sick of seeing the same terrain at trail centres, an decided a lakes ride was in order.

Loweswater is the closest to where i would be this easter weekend - about 4/5 miles away from where my parents live, and a lovely little drive. With the right weather supposed to be showing it's face, i texted [James](http://twitter.com/jimmyb_47) to see if he wanted to accompany me.

With an OS map in hand, a route i'd dug up from the internet, and the fiesta packed with both bikes, we headed out in search of Maggie's bridge, and the start of the route, but it wasn't going to be so easy to find for a bunch of numpties like us. After 15 minutes and a few u-turns though, we ended up doing what we know best, finding the pub, and parking there.

The weather was absolutely beautiful - the wind from the day before had died down, and the sun's heat was just enough, we started pedalling towards High Nook farm, and through it, past the silently vigilant border collie on the step.

I had failed to look at the profile of the route - turns out if you do it this way, it's a huge climb straight off the bat - considering i'd spent my 'off season' drinking beer and eating meals mainly consisting of meat, this was going to be a long climbâ€¦

James was even suffering from the onset of a cold and the remaining effects of a hangover from the night earlier. We both resorted to pushing, as the grade of the hill was a bit too steep to comfortably spin up in low gear.

The "worst" was yet to come - the route turns back onto itself, up the side of Carling Knott, the start of the big climb; but it would be worth it, wouldn't it?

The top of the climb, about 20 minutes later, looked promising, like we were about to open up onto some classic lakes-style singletrack along the back of Holme wood, i hopped on the pedals and spun up to speed, finally feeling like this was a ride and not a hike.

Unfortunately, it lasted for all of about a minute - there's another steep (but short) climb to contend with after this, pushing again! I think we'll get dropped off in a helicopter next time.

We finally reached the top right corner of the wood, we thought we'd take the time to sit and rest our legs before we hit what we thought would inevitably be the descending part - we were so close to the top, where else was there to go but down?

From here though, it got a bit more fun, and a bit faster. There's a few more short climbs, but they're rideable, and despite avoiding a photographer and his tripod, there's very little to contend with obstacle-wise.

The views back to the water are stunning from along here too.

A wide, and steep in parts, section of the bridleway brings you down the side of the mountain fairly quickly, we had to avoid some tourists who were too busy watching their feet to see two high-speed bikers coming down at them. We were having so much fun coming down that we overshot the turn to Iredale Place, ending up at the road.

Doubling back, we passed through several gates and began descending down the fields towards the wood again - there's a lot of gates on this route, that's for sure.

This small section pictured below was probably one of my favourite of the whole ride - incredibly rocky and technical, but a lot of fun to ride down.

From here, it was a simple matter of heading back through Holme woods, and towards the Kirkstyle Inn for a post-ride pint and some food. The pub was packed, and i was driving, so a half-pint of Loweswater Gold and some rushed soup later, we set off back home.

If you're looking for a good route to do as an introduction to lakes riding, like i was, this is a great route. Plus the Kirkstyle inn does accomodation and amazing food and beer.

What's not to like?
