Rationalisation is a strange thing, and probably the part of the human psyche that both scares and intrigues me the most.

We've all made mistakes, all of us, and we all try to rationalise why we made them, a valid rationalisation relieves us of guilt, and provides comfort that we acted in a way acceptable at the time.

The time spent rationalising things, in any normal person, becomes larger in proportion to the size of the mistake you may have made, guilt and the overriding truth of a situation make it harder, if not impossible, to reconcile within yourself.

The thing that scares me most is that rationality is intensely subjective to the individual performing the action, and is easily blinded by rage, or similar strong emotions. But more importantly, when rationality slips out of line with acceptable morality, it becomes a dangerous tool.

How else could people like anders breivic murder all those children and feel no remorse - he, in some sick way, had rationalised that act within himself before, during, and after. If he felt guilt, and was unable to suppress it with a (personally) valid rationalisation, then he would have shown remorse.

You see it in milder cases in those who act in ways that seem horrible to you: people who are extremely loud, violent, rude, narcissistic or appear to show no regard for common human principles. These people are able to rationalise their behaviour based on the wrong information, gathered through poor perception and other environmental factors.

Just FYI: this post, like many you might find here, doesn't have a *point*, but it was a line of inquiry that i found interesting during a discussion with a friend - that Rationality is completely subjective, as i often wondered how those who make billions or even trillions a year can look at the state of the world we live in, and somehow rationalise that they need, or even *deserve* all that money they have, when it could do so much good in the world.
