I'm incredibly excited to say that as of the 1st of October i'll be leaving Hydrant to persue a career on my own in the big wide world of freelancing.

I'm sad to be leaving the team i've been with for 5 years and had so many laughs with, and i wish them all the best and i'm incredibly grateful for all the things i've learned while working with them all.

But for now, it's time to take the next step and move into what i've dreamed of doing since i was at university.

*I'm available for work starting* early-mid november, so hit me up if you need something built for the web or mobile.

New site coming as soon as i can get everything together, so stay tuned!
