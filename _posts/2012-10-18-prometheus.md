**Warning: here be spoilers.**

I've held off posting about this film for a long time - The Alien universe is really close to my heart, so below is a collection of ramblings more than a coherent post.

* The visuals are stunning, the colours, everything, but it still retains a very 'alien' like feel in some of the space sequences.
* The music is just like the film, hopeful throughout with terrifying overtones.
* I do think that Guy Pearce' turn as the Peter Weyland is good, if unneccasary, they should have cast someone older, as another person put it: "The eyes always look too young, too shiny."
* David is obviously the standout star of this piece, his subtle 'emotions' - eye movements, who he looks at and when, are brilliant.
* I really do think this film gets better the more times you watch it.
* There are a few emotional moments that feel shoehorned in, especially to serve plotlines later on, Shaw's inability to conceive is one of them.
* When it goes wrong, it really goes wrong, Milburn and Fifield were the crescendo to that: their light-hearted cowardice is replaced with absolute terror when they encounter, the next 15 minutes is the slippery slope of the whole film, after this, nothing gets better.
* Charlie's end is not suited to him: he's self-absorped in a kind of way, and while i get his self-sacrificing gesture (i think he understands that this is the end for him) i think it's made up more of self-pity. He should have screamed more, this could have been so much more horrific, rather than some romantic gesture.
* I'm sorry, but THE FLUTE WAS A STUPID FUCKING IDEA, and i don't like the 'silly putty' controls the engineers have, but i do guess that they had to try and maintain consistency with Alien's engineer ship somehow, plus try to do something different.
* Janek, Ravel and Chance's sacrifices are so underplayed - there was the chance to make this so much more interesting, personal, and spectacular.
* I still don't think Vickers deserved the death she got - she was a fantastic character, i actually think it might have been more noble if she had stepped up to pilot the ship , but perhaps the fact she didn't speaks to her character being no deeper than what we'd already seen - a fearful, selfish bitch.

## Creature design

This is my *huge* bugbear with this movie: but let me preface this with a personal perspective:

When i was a kid, i don't remember how old, i saw alien, and then aliens, and for the first time in my life, i had trouble sleeping - i'd have the same recurring nightmare night after night, for months - a xenomorph creeping around my doorway, with that horrible visceral set of teeth and elongated head.

The creatures in this are *not* scary, they don't speak to any of the base instincts that make me fearful. I worked out that there's no real human-trilobyte contact in this film save the half-minute where Shaw unleashes it, how are we supposed to be afraid of something if we're unsure of it's capabilities against us? I get that the engineers are bigger and stronger than us, and that even the last engineer couldn't escape it's grasp, but it's no substitute for an actual battle of wits.

That brings me to the engineers, which are, in my opinion, the best part of the film. They intrigue me, their society, who they are, what they value, do they have females? SO MANY QUESTIONS - the best kinds of questions. The fact that they look like us, and like ancient greek paintings, delights me to no end.

## Religion

From Shaw's cross to the 2000 year ("give or take") gap between the 'event' that wiped LV-223's engineers from the planet and Prometheus' arrival, the film is full of religious undertones, which i'm fine with, the conflict of science and religion adds to the mystery of Shaw - why does she still believe? And more importantly - will she still believe at the end of the sequel?
