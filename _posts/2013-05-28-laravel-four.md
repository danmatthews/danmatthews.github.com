Later today Taylor will be releasing Laravel version 4 onto the world.

It's incredibly geeky to say this - but i've been following along with it's development closely, with baited breath, ever since i found [Laravel 3](http://laravel.com) and started working with [Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

Why do i love it so much? Because ever since i started doing serious (read: with a framework) development, i've searched for something that is expressive, promotes testing, doesn't force a strange autoload situation on you where models are prefixed (I'd rather use `new Book()` than `new Model_Book()`, and doesn't restrict your application structure, while still providing absolutely great built in tools, and has great extensibility.

Laravel 4 is all of the above and more. The entire core team has provided a framework that is just above and beyond everything i could want to do, along with the interoperability that comes with using Symfony Components and Composer.

All the extra great stuff is in there too - great mail handling, extremely easy queuing, great testability and abstraction, Facades so that you can switch out huge parts of the app without having to rewrite application code, it's almost too much.

All this, along with a steady 6-month-release cycle, a great community and a really open-to-contributions attitude, make it the best damn PHP framework available today.
