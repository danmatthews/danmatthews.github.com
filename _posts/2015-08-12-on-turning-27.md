description: A short personal dialogue about how i struggle to adjust to office hours.

A few weeks ago i turned 27, and although i’ve made many many mistakes in my life, i’ve always believed that you are defined by two things: the things you do, and the people you surround yourself with.

I may not be the perfect person, i may not lead a perfect life, or do things perfectly every day, but i do aspire to be better every day. I might not achieve that on a daily basis, but dammit, at least i’m trying.

Someone once told me that i had no goals in life, and that cut me deep, because my goal is to make the lives of those around me better in any way i can on a daily basis, if i can. If i can make you laugh, even once, then i’m a happy man. Plus it’s always nice to build cool apps and make money with your friends.

27 years (shit, i’m nearly 30!) has taught me so many things.

To the friends i haven’t seen properly in years - dammit, i miss you all, and i miss the old times, and i wish you all the best.

And to my closest friends i say - thank you, and the drinks are on me the next time i see you, even though it was *my* birthday, you cheap bastards. Because i’m soft like that.
