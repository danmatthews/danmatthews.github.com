Simply Satisfied is a quick way to collect customer feedback, build a survey, send email invites, and view your performance over time.

### [HeartBeat Statusboard](http://github.com/danmatthews/HeartBeat)
A super-simple open-source dashboard for your office, built on the <a href="http://laravel.com">Laravel</a> framework with a little <a href="http://emberjs.com">EmberJS</a> sprinkled on top. Comes complete with responsive theme, email alerts and twitter feed.

### [MakeADrupalModule.com](http://makeadrupalmodule.com)
I make tonnes of custom drupal modules every week, and i was tired of writing the directories, info files, and boilerplate code from scratch each time.


### [Sanction](https://github.com/danmatthews/sanction-php)
A PHP role and permission based access control library. Framework agnostic but works seamlessly with [Laravel 4](http://laravel.com). Define your roles and permissions as an array structure, pass to Sanction, and it'll cache them and prepare them for checking against.
